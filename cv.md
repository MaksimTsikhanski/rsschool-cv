### __About Me__
I am 31 years old, I work as a Lead Design Engineer. My job is to develop design documentation for the production of complete transformer substations, the development of low, medium and high voltage relay protection and protection circuits. Also, my responsibilities include designing industrial automation schemes, telemechanics, writing programs and parameterizing PLCs, protection terminals and automation devices. But unfortunately in our country it is difficult to find a job with decent pay. That is why I decided to study a profession in IT. I think that my actual job will lead me to stagnation some day or other. I really need in activities where I can develop during my life. That is why I`m here. My goal is to gain knowledge in the field of front-end development.
